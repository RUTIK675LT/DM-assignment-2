1.) Install pycaret 
` !pip install pycaret `
2.) Upload dataset either locally or with google drive into required ML model
3.) Train model using "setup" function

# DM Assignments 1 and 2

## Assignment 1 - 
#### Used chat-gpt 4 to analyse dataset from kaggle
1. Download a popular dataset from kaggle
2. Upload the data-set in Chat-gpt 4
3. Give exact prompt required for data analysis
4. Keep prompting until satisfactory results are obtained


## Assignment 2-
#### Used github copilot(gpt-engineer) to code a web based app using a simple prompt
*gpt-engineer github link-*
https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/tree/main



#### Generate apps using github copilot (gpt-engineer) with a single prompt!
1.) Create a folder, and a prompt (text file) for gpt-engineer

2.) Install gpt-engineer with command :-
     `python -m pip install gpt-engineer`

3.) Set key OPENAI API key with following command :-
    `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`

4.) Enter prompt of the application to create in the text file

5.) To run the prompt :-
    `gpt-engineer [folder name]`
